This python module is designed to talk to different LCD screens using their different functions on the Raspberry Pi.  The next LCD module to be included will be the ADAFruit Serial/USB back pack LCD.

Requirements:
To use this module you must have the following librarys on your system.
Pyserial - This library is used to talk to devices through the serial/usb port.
Python Imaging Library - This library is used to convert picture files into a readable format for the LCD screen to use.

Enable the use of the Rx/Tx pins on the Raspberry Pi (note all these steps are done as root), this assumes you are using
Raspbian.
